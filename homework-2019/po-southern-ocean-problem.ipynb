    "A very rough model of the Southern Ocean overturning is wind-driven Ekman pumping pushing warm water out near the surface and geostrophc transport below the depth of topography provding the return flow. \n",

    "1. Calculate the net Ekman-driven volume transport out the Southern Ocean near 55S assuming that the zonal wind strength is 0.1 N m$^{-2}$. Give you answer in Sv.\n",
    "1. Calculate the required geostrophic inflow to keep the volume budget balance, assuming zero net E-P-R below 55S. (Yes, this is trivial.)\n",
    "1. Calculate the heat transport by this flow across 55S. Give your answer in PW (10$^{15}$ W). Explain your sign convention.\n",
    "1. Calculate the required average air-sea heat flux into the ocean south of 55S needed to balance the heat budget. Explain your sign convention.\n",
    "1. Compare to the observed air-sea flux [from our notes](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/rabernat/intro_to_physical_oceanography/blob/master/lectures/03_air_sea_exchange.ipynb). Are they compatible? \n",
    "1. We now assume meridional eddy diffusion is responsible for the missing heat transport. Let's assume the eddies transfer heat according to the formula\n",

    "where $K_{eddy}$ is the eddy diffusion coeeficient. Estimate the value of $K_{eddy}$ to one significant digit."
