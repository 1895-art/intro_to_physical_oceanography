## Why Python ##

A great deal has been written on [this subject](http://cyrille.rossant.net/why-using-python-for-scientific-computing/).
My reasons are summarized as follows.

1. __Python is open source__. [Open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source)
means that the source code is available freely to the public and can be examined,
modified, and improved. The alternative to open source is closed, proprietary.
Proprietary tools, such as MATLAB, are ultimately controlled by corporations, and
those corporations decide what features they will include. I consider software
tools as a central part of scientific research---if we want to have transparent,
reproducible, scientific results, we should be using open source tools.
[Nature](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v482/n7386/full/nature10836.html)
agrees with me.

1. __Python is free__. It does not cost money to use python. If your scientific
code is written in MATLAB, it can only be run by others with access to MATLAB.
That means people outside the university world (e.g. high school students), in
economically disadvantaged communities, or in developing countries will be
unable to reproduce and build on your results.

1. __Python is easy to read__. This may seem like a superficial point, but it is
crucial for effective sharing of code. Even if you are the only one reading
your code, python is easy on the eyes.

1. __Python has a great library__. The [scipy ecosystem](http://scipy.org)
provides the tools to do almost anything you can imagine.

1. __Python is constantly evolving__. If you find something you _can't_ do with
python, chances are someone is working on it. The world is changing: data is
exploding, computers architecture is evolving, and new forms of analysis and
visualization are being invented. Python is evolving too, and it evolves based
on what the community needs. The new tool I am most excited about is
[xray](http://continuum.io/blog/xray-dask).

1. __Python is at home on the web__. The [Jupyter project](https://jupyter.org/)
grew out of the python community and is revolutionizing the way we do science
and communicate it with others. With Jupyter, I never have to leave my browser.
[Nature agrees](http://www.nature.com/news/interactive-notebooks-sharing-the-code-1.16261)
that this is the future of scientific communication.
